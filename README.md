# Automatic Tile Size Selection Modeling

Automatic creation of tile size selection models using ML methods. Inspired by Yuki et al.'s [paper][1]. Adapted for the [ROSE compiler][3].
Training and test data sets are generated from [PolyBench 3.1][4].

## Overview

To automatically model the tile size selection problem, this project contains code that:
1. Automatically extracts relevant loop features that are relevant for deciding optimal tile size. Refer to the [paper][1] for these features.
2. Performs an empirical search for an optimal tile size for each input file.
3. Uses each optimal tile size and loop feature pair to train a number of ML models to predict an optimal tile size.
4. Uses the trained models in a ROSE pass such that unseen programs can be automatically tiled

## Usage and file descriptions

- `GenerateTiledBenchmarks.C:` A ROSE pass that, for each tile candidate loop, extracts features of the loop and outputs a program with that loop tiled to a range of different tile sizes (i.e. {1, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256} by default). Loop features for each test case are appended as a row to a csv file `features.csv`
- `generate_all_tiled_benchmarks.sh:` A bash file that calls `GenerateTiledBenchmarks.C` on all benchmarks in the `benchmarks/polybench-3.1` directory and stores each output to a directory named `tiled_polybench/`.
- `measure_runtimes.sh:` A bash file that measures the runtime of each tiled polybench program in `tiled_polybench/`. Stores each result as a row in a csv file `tiled_polybench/runtimes.csv`
- `notebooks/tile_size_analysis.ipynb:` A jupyter notebook that reads in the `tiled_polybench/runtimes.csv` and `tiled_polybench/features.csv` files into dataframes, performs some feature processing, preps data for training, and finally trains a number of scikit-learn classifiers to predict the empirically chosen optimal tile sizes and saves these models into the `models/` directory
- `predict_tile_size.py:` A python program that takes in loop features as command line arguments and performances inference with the trained models. Outputs the prediction into a specified file.
- `AutoTile.C:` A ROSE pass that for each tile candidate loop, extracts features of the loop, calls `predict_tile_size.py` with these features, and finally uses the predicted tile sizes to automatically tile the program
